This C++ program includes class definitions for "Weapon," "Sword," "Nunchucks," and "Ninja," showcasing inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, destructors, operator overloading, and dynamic memory allocation. The code illustrates a "has-a" relationship between "Ninja" and "Weapon" classes, indicating composition. It also features member functions for accessing and modifying object attributes, such as name, health, and attack skill. The main function initializes objects, simulates combat scenarios between two ninjas equipped with different weapons, and determines the winner based on remaining health points. Additionally, commented-out sections demonstrate alternative scenarios with different weapon combinations. Overall, the code highlights object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, in the context of a combat simulation.
