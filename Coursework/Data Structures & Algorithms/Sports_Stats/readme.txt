The first class, SportsStats, serves as a base class with protected data members and public getter and setter methods. It includes a constructor to initialize data upon object creation and a toString() method to convert object data to a string. Inheriting from SportsStats, the BasketballPlayer and BaseballPlayer classes add specific attributes and methods related to basketball and baseball statistics, respectively. Both derived classes feature constructors that initialize their unique attributes and override the toString() method to include additional information. The main function instantiates objects of these classes and demonstrates their usage by printing player information to the console. Overall, the code employs concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, constructor initialization, method overriding, and polymorphism to model sports player statistics effectively.
