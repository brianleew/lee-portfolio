This course is called, "CSC-1310, Data Structures and Algorithms," and it was my second computer science class that I took during the Spring 2020 term (Jan - May) at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, TN. This was a like a sequel to "CSC-1300, Intro/Prob Solving-Comp Prog" (my very first coding experience). These courseworks do not reflect the full workload of the course. Besides these courseworks, there were some exams, smaller labs, and attendance of lectures (optional) which I have attended every class. Although I do not have the exact prompt assigned by the instructor (I did not think it was important to save it at the time), I tried my best to organize the original work that I have completed on here. Overall, these courseworks represent my sequential progress of learning the aspects of C++.
