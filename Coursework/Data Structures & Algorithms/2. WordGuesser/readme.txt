The "WordGuesser" program is an interactive game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word. The game provides a series of dashes representing the letters of the word, and the player must guess individual letters to reveal them. However, the player has a limited number of attempts before the game ends.

The program is implemented using object-oriented principles in C++. It consists of a WordGuess class that encapsulates the game logic, including storing the solution word, tracking guessed letters, managing misses, and determining the game's state.

Upon instantiation of the WordGuess class with a chosen solution word, the game initializes and displays the initial puzzle state. The player then inputs their guesses, and the program updates the puzzle accordingly, revealing correct guesses and incrementing misses for incorrect guesses.

The game continues until either the player successfully guesses the entire word, reaches the maximum allowed misses, or correctly guesses the word. After each guess, the program updates and displays the current puzzle state, guessed letters, number of misses, and whether the game is over.

"WordGuesser" provides an engaging exercise in string manipulation, user input handling, and game state management, offering entertainment while reinforcing programming concepts.
