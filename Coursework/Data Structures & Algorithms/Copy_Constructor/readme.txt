The main class MyInteger encapsulates an integer value and provides methods to access and modify it. Key techniques include dynamic memory allocation using new, as seen in the constructor, and pointer manipulation to manage memory. The code showcases the implementation of a copy constructor to create a new object initialized with the values of an existing object. Additionally, operator overloading is employed to define custom behavior for the assignment (=) and addition (+) operators. The code also features comments demonstrating how to test various functionalities like copy constructors, operator overloading, and basic variable assignment. Overall, the code highlights concepts such as dynamic memory management, copy constructors, operator overloading, and basic C++ syntax like variable initialization and function invocation.
