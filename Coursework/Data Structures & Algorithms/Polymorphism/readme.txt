The C++ code in polymorphism.cpp demonstrates various programming techniques and syntax elements. It defines a hierarchy of classes using inheritance, with the base class Animal and derived classes Mammal and Reptile. Each class overrides the virtual function my_features(), allowing for polymorphic behavior. The Animal class serves as an abstract base class, as it contains a pure virtual function my_features(), denoted by the = 0 syntax, requiring derived classes to implement it. In the main() function, polymorphism is showcased through the use of pointers to base class objects, with dynamic binding ensuring the correct function implementation is called based on the object type. This illustrates the concept of runtime polymorphism, where the function to be called is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type. Overall, the code demonstrates key concepts such as inheritance, virtual functions, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation in C++.
