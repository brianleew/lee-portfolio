This program includes file handling using ifstream and ofstream for reading from and writing to text files, respectively. The code utilizes string manipulation functions like find and replace to search for occurrences of a specific word (e.g., "boy") in each line of the input file and replace it with another word (e.g., "girl"). It employs a while loop to iterate through each line of the input file, reads the content line by line, performs the replacement operation, and writes the modified content to a new output file. Additionally, error handling is implemented to handle situations where the input file is not found. Overall, the code demonstrates basic file handling, string manipulation, and loop control in C++.
