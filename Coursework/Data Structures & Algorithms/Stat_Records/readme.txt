This C++ code encompasses class inheritance, where classes like StockStatRecord and BaseballStatRecord inherit from AbstractRecord, demonstrating object-oriented principles. The code utilizes constructor initialization lists to initialize base class members in derived class constructors efficiently. Additionally, it demonstrates method overriding with the toString() function in derived classes to provide custom string representations. The code implements file handling with ifstream for reading data from CSV files and stringstream for parsing individual lines into vectors. It showcases the use of vectors to store and manipulate data read from CSV files efficiently. Moreover, the code exemplifies the use of polymorphism and abstraction with AbstractCSVReader acting as a base class for specialized CSV reader classes like StocksCSVReader and BaseballCSVReader, demonstrating the power of inheritance and abstraction in C++ programming.
