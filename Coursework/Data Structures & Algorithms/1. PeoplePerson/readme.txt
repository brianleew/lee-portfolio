The coursework titled "PeoplePerson" involves designing and implementing a system to manage personal information using object-oriented programming principles. The system comprises classes for individuals (Person) and a data container for managing multiple individual records (PersonData).

The Person class encapsulates attributes such as name, age, and weight, along with appropriate accessor and mutator methods for data manipulation. On the other hand, the PersonData class acts as a container for managing multiple Person objects, with functionalities for adding, removing, and accessing individual records.

The coursework focuses on understanding concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and dynamic memory allocation in C++. It involves implementing functionalities to manipulate data efficiently, including resizing the data structure dynamically to accommodate new records, as demonstrated in the provided code.

With this coursework, I learned how to design and implement a modular and efficient data management system, enabled me to understand the importance of data organization and manipulation in real-world applications. Through this coursework, I gained practical experience in handling personal information data structures, essential for various software applications such as databases, contact lists, and personnel management systems.
