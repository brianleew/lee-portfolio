This course is called, "CSC-1300 Intro/Prob Solving-Comp Prog", and it was my very first computer science class that I took during the Fall 2019 term (Aug - Dec) at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, TN. This was my first time learning to code and solving problems with code. These coursework do not reflect the full workload of the course. Besides these coursework, there were some exams, smaller labs, and attendance of lectures (optional) which I have attended every class. Although I do not have the exact prompt assigned by the instructor (I did not think it was important to save it at the time), I tried my best to organize the original work that I have completed on here as well as the description and explanation for each of them. Overall, these coursework represent my initial progress of learning the fundamental aspects of C++ and coding/programming in general.
