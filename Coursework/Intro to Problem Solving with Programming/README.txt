This course is called, "CSC-1300, Intro/Prob Solving-Comp Prog", and it was my very first computer science class that I took during the Fall 2019 term (Aug - Dec) at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, TN. This was my first time learning to code and solving problems with code. These courseworks do not reflect the full workload of the course. Besides these courseworks, there were some exams, smaller labs, and attendance of lectures (optional) which I have attended every class. Although I do not have the exact prompt assigned by the instructor (I did not think it was important to save it at the time), I tried my best to organize the original work that I have completed on here. Overall, these courseworks represent my initial progress of learning the aspects of C++.
