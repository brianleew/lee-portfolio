This course is called, "CSC-2400 Design of Algorithms". These coursework do not reflect the full workload of the course. In addition to these courseworks, I had homework and in-class practice exercises to learn the basic concepts, logic, and structure of various algorithms and practiced following its algorithmic procedures, which did not involve any code. Each directory contains the prompt assigned by the instructor and its corresponding output or work written in C++. Overall, these coursework aided the ability to follow directions, implement prompt into code, and learn how such algorithms are implemented with code.
