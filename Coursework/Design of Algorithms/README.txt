This course is called, "CSC-2400 Design of Algorithms". These coursework do not reflect the full workload of the course. In addition to these courseworks, I had homework and in-class practice exercises to learn the basic concepts, logic, and structure of various algorithms and practiced following its algorithmic procedures, which did not involve any code. Each directory contains the initial prompt assigned by the instructor, and the corresponding output or work I produced.
