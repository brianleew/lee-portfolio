This purpose of this project was to explore, learn, and use a brand new coding language: Javascript. All the '**.js' files other than 'construction.js' and 'roomDefense.js' had already been started by my team mate before the project had started. He refactored to improve his code during the project progression. Take a loot at 'screeps_4903_team_one > screeps_code > readme.md' for more detailed information regarding 'construction.js' and 'roomDefense.js' that I have worked on during the project progression.
