This is was my undergraduate senior capstone project to experience what it means to be a software engineer. This project took about 6 months which involved a team of 7 people to deliver a functional web application, practicing AGILE workflow. The main purpose was to build a web platform for power consumers and providers to visualize statistical representation of aggregate or single data of users as well as managing and organizing user data. I primarily worked on the back-end API for the administrator and organization pages that would handle modifying, adding, or deleting data from the database to ensure accuracy of information displayed and stored. We started this project from scratch, and it was a very valuable project involving diligent teammates that taught me the importance of teamwork and self-accountability.
