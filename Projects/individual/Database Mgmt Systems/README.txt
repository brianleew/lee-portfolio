CSC-3300-001, Database Management Systems, is a computer science course required by all undergraduates majoring in computer science at Tennessee Tech University. For me, this course was taken in the Fall 2022 term (August - December). These projects do not reflect all of the workload for the whole course. There were several exams, lectures, study time, etc. involved. I have completed this multi-part project by myself and turned it in a timely manner. This project represents some of my understanding and writing of SQL queries, and the process of learning a brand new concept; it also aided in my understanding about the database management systems in general.
