This project called, "csc4903_copilot". It consists of a project that I was able to pick which was a Python game created from scratch using Github Copilot. Most of the code and other implementations were assisted by Github Copilot 3.5 and ChatGPT 4. I came up with the design and creativity. This was a test to see if I can tackle a daunting task that I have never done, such as creating a game from scratch, if I was able to use a generative AI tool. The code of the game is in: "csc4903_copilot > students > Brian > game_zap > src > zap.py". The test that verifies game code is in: "students > Brian > game_zap > test > test_zap.py. Due to the time contraint, I was not able to completely finish creating the full game.
